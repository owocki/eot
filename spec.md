Here’s a clean, detailed **spec for a remake or remix of Nicky Case’s "Evolution of Trust" game**, structured like a product/game design document.

## Title

**Evolution of Trust (Remix / Spec)**

---

## 1. Overview

**Goal:**
Simulate and visualize how trust and cooperation evolve in repeated social dilemmas (e.g., the Prisoner’s Dilemma).
Players interact with AI agents (or other players) through multiple rounds of a simple “trust or cheat” game, observing how different strategies perform and evolve over time.

**Core Theme:**
Trust requires:

* Repeated interactions
* Possible communication or memory
* A nonzero-sum environment

---

## 2. Core Game Loop

**Each round:**

1. The player faces another agent (human or AI).
2. Both choose **Cooperate (trust)** or **Defect (cheat)**.
3. The outcome gives payoffs based on the standard payoff matrix (below).
4. Repeat for N rounds or until the player’s trust level collapses.

**Payoff Matrix (example):**

| You \ Opponent | Cooperate | Defect  |
| -------------- | --------- | ------- |
| **Cooperate**  | +3 / +3   | 0 / +5  |
| **Defect**     | +5 / 0    | +1 / +1 |

---

## 3. Agents (Strategies)

Each AI represents a “philosophy” of trust.
They differ by how they decide to cooperate or defect based on past rounds.

| Name                              | Description               | Rules                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Always Cooperate (Cooperator)** | Naive trust.              | Always plays “Cooperate.”                                     |
| **Always Cheat (Defector)**       | Exploitative.             | Always plays “Defect.”                                        |
| **Tit for Tat**                   | Reciprocator.             | Cooperate on first round, then mirror opponent’s last move.   |
| **Grudger**                       | Forgiving until betrayed. | Cooperate until opponent defects once, then always defect.    |
| **Random**                        | Unpredictable.            | 50% chance each move.                                         |
| **Detective**                     | Prober/Adaptive.          | Cooperate 1st round, defect 2nd, then adapt based on results. |

## 4. Evolution Mechanic

**Simulation Mode:**
After the player experiences these strategies, the game transitions to an **evolution simulation**:

1. A population of agents (e.g., 100) with different strategies plays repeated games.
2. After each generation, agents with higher scores “reproduce,” replacing lower-performing agents.
3. Over time, certain strategies dominate or go extinct.
4. Optional: introduce **noise** (occasional mistaken moves) to simulate imperfect communication.

**Parameters:**

* Population size: 100
* Rounds per match: 10
* Generations: 50
* Mutation rate: 5%
* Noise rate: 1–5%

---

## 5. Visual/UX Design

**Aesthetic:**
Clean 2D flat visuals inspired by Nicky Case’s interactive style:

* Circles representing agents
* Lines or colors to indicate cooperation/defection
* Smooth transitions and narration bubbles
* Use of explanatory text between phases

**Visual cues:**

* Green for cooperation, red for defection
* Arrows showing score flow
* Animated “evolution bar” showing population percentages per strategy

---

## 6. Levels / Structure

1. **Tutorial (Guided)**: Explains rules using single rounds and static examples.
2. **Playground (Interactive)**: Player faces each strategy type one by one.
3. **Evolution (Simulated)**: Automatic rounds showing how cooperation evolves or collapses.
4. **Sandbox (Free Play)**: Player adjusts parameters like noise, population mix, and payoff matrix.

---

## 7. Educational Narrative

Between each section, short narrative text explains key lessons:

* “Why can’t we trust everyone?”
* “Why repetition matters.”
* “How mistakes and forgiveness shape outcomes.”
* “Why our modern world breaks these trust loops.”

Optionally end with a modern analogy (social media, open source, DAOs, etc.) showing real-world multipolar traps.

---

## 8. Implementation Details

**Tech Stack:**

* Web-based interactive simulation (HTML5 / JS)
* Libraries: D3.js or p5.js for visualization, GSAP for animation
* Optional React or Svelte for UI flow
* Optional data export to visualize agent populations over time

**Core objects (pseudocode):**

```js
class Agent {
  constructor(strategy) { this.strategy = strategy; this.memory = []; }
  decide(opponentHistory) { /* based on strategy rules */ }
}

class Game {
  constructor(agentA, agentB, rounds) { /* run payoff loop */ }
}

class Population {
  constructor(agents) { /* evolutionary simulation */ }
  evolve() { /* reproduction by fitness */ }
}
```

---

## 9. Extensions / Remix Ideas

* **DAO version:** Agents represent DAOs funding each other based on perceived trust.
* **AI version:** Agents learn strategy via reinforcement learning.
* **Public goods mode:** Multiple players contribute to a common pool instead of binary trust/defect.
* **On-chain simulation:** Implement payoff logic on a smart contract for transparent scoring.
* **Custom strategies:** Players can code their own in a simple editor.

---

## 10. Metrics / Success Criteria

* Player completes the tutorial and evolution simulation.
* 70%+ of players understand the connection between repetition, communication, and cooperation.
* Average session time: 5–10 minutes.
* Optional quiz or reflection question at the end (“What helps trust evolve?”).

Would you like me to make a **React + p5.js implementation spec** (with component hierarchy, state machine, and file structure) next? That would make this spec executable for a developer team.
