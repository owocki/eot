Perfect. Here’s a detailed **spec for a crypto-native, on-chain multiplayer version of *The Evolution of Trust***—a Web3 social experiment that merges **game theory, Ethereum identity, and skin-in-the-game signaling**.

---

# **Spec: Evolution of Trust (Crypto Edition)**

### **Tagline:**

*A web3 social experiment about cooperation, betrayal, and skin-in-the-game.*

---

## 1. Overview

**Goal:**
Two players stake **0.001 ETH each** to play a blockchain-based **Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma**.
They log in with Ethereum, play several rounds of a trust-or-betray game, and the smart contract automatically sends both bonds (0.002 ETH) to the winner based on final score.

**Core message:**
Blockchain makes *trustless* systems possible—but can it also help us rebuild *trustworthy* ones?

---

## 2. Game Loop (Gameplay Flow)

### Step 1: **Login & Bond**

* Players connect wallets via MetaMask or WalletConnect.
* Smart contract escrows **0.001 ETH bond** from each player.
* Once both deposits are received, the game lobby starts.

### Step 2: **Match Setup**

* Two players are randomly matched (or invite-based).
* Game lasts **10 rounds**.
* Each round, both players choose:

  * **Trust (Cooperate)**
  * **Cheat (Defect)**

### Step 3: **Payoff Matrix**

| You \ Opponent | Trust   | Cheat   |
| -------------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Trust**      | +3 / +3 | 0 / +5  |
| **Cheat**      | +5 / 0  | +1 / +1 |

Each player's *score* accumulates across rounds. The interface updates both sides in real-time.

### Step 4: **Game End**

* After 10 rounds, the smart contract computes:

  * **Total score** for each player.
  * The player with the higher total receives **the combined bond (0.002 ETH)**.
* In case of a tie, funds are split evenly.

## 3. On-Chain Architecture

### **Smart Contract (Solidity)**

**Contract: `EvolutionOfTrust.sol`**

**Core functions:**

```solidity
function createGame() external payable; // Requires msg.value == 0.001 ether
function joinGame(uint gameId) external payable; // Requires msg.value == 0.001 ether
function submitMove(uint gameId, bool cooperate) external; // True = Trust, False = Cheat
function finalizeGame(uint gameId) external; // Called automatically or manually after final round
function withdrawWinnings(uint gameId) external;
```

**Storage:**

* `mapping(uint => Game)` where `Game` contains:

  * `address playerA`
  * `address playerB`
  * `uint256 bondAmount`
  * `uint8 round`
  * `uint8[10] movesA`
  * `uint8[10] movesB`
  * `uint256 scoreA`
  * `uint256 scoreB`
  * `bool isFinalized`

**Security:**

* Prevent re-entrancy with `nonReentrant`.
* Ensure fairness (no double submission per round).
* Optionally add Chainlink Keepers to auto-finalize stale games.

## 4. Front-End Architecture

**Tech Stack:** just use whatever you're already using

### **UI Flow**

1. **Connect Wallet Screen**
   “Connect with Ethereum to play the Trust Game.”

2. **Bond Deposit Screen**

   * Shows transaction modal for 0.001 ETH.
   * Displays “waiting for another player…”

3. **Game Board (10 rounds)**

   * Two player icons (ENS or EAS badges).
   * Buttons: [Trust] and [Cheat].
   * Visuals: colored lines (green = cooperation, red = betrayal).
   * Running score shown on both sides.

4. **Results Screen**

   * Displays final scores, outcomes, and payout transaction.
   * Optional share link: “Play your friends at evolutionoftrust.eth”

---

## 5. Visual Design / Aesthetic

* **Style:** Retro cyber-minimalist inspired by Nicky Case.
* **Color Palette:**

  * Trust: #6CF5B0 (green mint)
  * Cheat: #FF6B6B (red coral)
  * Background: dark blue/black gradient (#0F1626 → #1C2232)
* **Typography:** IBM Plex Sans
* **Animations:** Smooth lines and pulsing dots for interaction rounds.

---

## 6. Trust Mechanics (Crypto Layer)

* **Wallet Identity:** ENS name and Ethereum address visible on screen.
* **Reputation System (Optional):**

  * Record game outcomes via an **EAS attestation** (e.g., “0xabc cooperated 7/10 times”).
  * Build a “Trust Score” across matches.
* **Optional NFT Badge:**
  Mintable “Trustworthy” or “Deceiver” NFT after 10 games.

---

## 8. Smart Contract Economics

* **Gas efficiency:** store minimal data, use events for frontend logging.
* **Treasury hook (optional):** 0.5% fee goes to contract creator.
* **Configurable bond amount:** allow players to choose higher stakes.

---

## 9. Educational Layer (Narrative)

Between rounds, show short educational snippets:

* “This is a one-shot game: trust rarely evolves.”
* “Now imagine playing 10 times with the same person.”
* “Repetition builds reputation. Blockchain remembers.”

Optional final reflection:

> “In crypto, we built systems that don’t require trust.
> The next challenge is building systems that *deserve* it.”

---

## 10. Success Metrics

* 500+ unique wallet plays in first month.
* 30% of users return for a second match.
* Positive Twitter/X engagement around “I trusted and lost / I trusted and won.”
